# Retail Customer Analytics & Reporting System

**Project Overview**  
This project, originally titled **MegaMetrix Mart**, is a comprehensive retail customer analytics solution designed to optimize business operations, enhance customer engagement, and support data-driven decision making. Using advanced data analytics techniques in Python and Microsoft Excel, the system analyzes customer behavior, identifies high-value segments, tracks repeat purchase patterns, and generates personalized product recommendations — all consolidated in a single master Excel sheet.

## Key Features
- **Customer Segmentation:** Applied K-Means clustering to group customers based on purchasing behavior.  
- **Money-Centric Analysis:** Identified top-spending and loyal customers to prioritize targeted marketing campaigns.  
- **Repetition & Engagement Patterns:** Tracked repeat purchase behavior to highlight active and returning customers.  
- **Recommendation Engine:** Used collaborative filtering to suggest products based on historical purchases and preferences.  
- **Favorite Products Analysis:** Compiled customer-favorite items to inform merchandising and promotional strategies.  

## Impact & Metrics
- Processed and analyzed **25,000+ product records** and **thousands of customer transactions** in a single Excel master sheet.  
- Enabled **segmentation of customers into actionable clusters**, improving targeted marketing strategies.  
- Generated **personalized recommendations and insights**, providing clear, data-driven guidance for operational improvements.
